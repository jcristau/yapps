The Debian Package yapps2
-------------------------

This package contains several upward-compatible enhancements to the
original YAPPS source:
- Handle stacked input ("include files")
- augmented ignore-able patterns
  (this means that yapps2 now can parse things like multi-line C comments)
- better error reporting
- read input incrementally

Traditionally, the yapps runtime is called yappsrt.py and it was
installed with the binary that uses the parser. However, as soon as
there is more than one of those, this method breaks.

Therefore, and because the new runtime isn't entirely compatible to the
old yappsrt.py, I decided to rename the generated parser to
yapps/runtime.py. It is provided by the yapps2-runtime package.
You need to depend on this package if you Debianize Python programs that
use yapps2.
